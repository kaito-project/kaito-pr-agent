## Why We Forked PR-Agent

We forked [qodo-ai/pr-agent](https://github.com/qodo-ai/pr-agent) to integrate **Kaito RAGEngine** as the backend, improving PR-Agent's performance by gathering additional context from your codebase. This enhanced contextual understanding allows for more accurate code reviews, better suggestions, and smarter PR descriptions.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Get started in minutes with GitHub integration:

### GitHub Action (Recommended)
Easy setup, no infrastructure needed. **[Setup Guide â†’](docs/docs/installation/github.md#run-as-a-github-action)**

### GitHub App (Advanced)
More control, runs in your infrastructure. **[Setup Guide â†’](docs/docs/installation/github.md#run-as-a-github-app)**

> **Prerequisites:** You'll need a [Kaito workspace](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito) running with your preferred model.

> **Live Example:** The kaito-pr-agent GitHub App with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B model is actively reviewing all PRs in the [Kaito repository](https://github.com/Azure/kaito).
